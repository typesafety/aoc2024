Inputs and example inputs go here:

* Inputs are named named `day<DAY>.txt`, where `<DAY>` is a number padded to
  length two (i.e. `day03.txt` and not `day3.txt`).

* Example inputs are named `day<DAY>_example<NUM>.txt`, where `<NUM>` is a
  non-padded number (e.g. `day03_example1.txt`).

For example, an input file and one example input file for day 1 would be named
like this:

```
aoc2024/
+-- inputs/
    |-- day01.txt
    +-- day01_example1.txt
```
